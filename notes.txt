Software Requirements:
    * Go tools (https://go.dev/dl)    
    * Visual Studio Code (https://code.VisualStudio.com/download)
    * Go extension for Visual Studio Code (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)


Why Golang?
    * Performance
        Equivalent to C++ without the hassles of manual memory management
        Close to hardware (No VMs)
        Tool support for cross compilation
    * Simplicity
        Only 25 keywords
        - No access modifiers (No public, private, protected etc)
        - No classes (only structs)
        - No inheritance (only composition)
        - No exceptions (only errors)
        - No "try catch finally" construct
        - No reference types (everything is a value in golang)
        - No pointer arithmetic (Pointers are supported)
        - No implicit type conversions
        - No manual memory management (builtin GC)
    * Concurrency
        - Goroutines
        - Goroutines are cheap(4 kb) whereas OS thread(2 MB)
        - Builtin Scheduler
        - Concurrency features are built in the language
            ex: go keyword, channel data type, channel operator ( <- ), range & select case constructs
        - APIs for concurrency in the standard library
            sync package
            sync/atomic package

To run a go program
    go run <file_name.go>

To create a build
    go build <file_name.go>
    go build -o <build_name> <file_name.go>

to cross compile an application / program

To list ALL the environment variables
    go env

To list specific environment variables
    go env GOARCH GOOS

To update the environment variables
    go env -w <variable_1>=<value_1> <variable_2>=<value_2>

To get the list of support OS & processor architecture
    go tool dist list

To cross compile 
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build 01-hello-world.go
